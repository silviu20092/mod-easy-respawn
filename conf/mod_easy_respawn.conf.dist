#
#    EasyRespawn.ResurrectMapMask
#        Description: Specifies a mask (bitwise or) specifying where the system is active. The system takes effect for playerbots aswell.
#        Values: 0 - Disabled
#                1 - Works in dungeons
#                2 - Works in raids
#                4 - Works in open world
#        Examples: If you want the system active in dungeons & open world only (so not in raids), just use a bitwise or between 1 and 4 (result = 5).
#                  If you want to disable the system, just use 0
#        Default: 7 (1 | 2 | 4) - active everywhere
#

EasyRespawn.ResurrectMapMask = 7

#
#    EasyRespawn.ResurrectPct
#        Description: When player is automatically resurrected, sets the current health percentage.
#        Values: Between 0.1 (resurrected with 10% health) an 1 (100% health). A value of 0.5 means the player will be resurrected with half hp.
#        Default: 1
#

EasyRespawn.ResurrectPct = 1

#
#    EasyRespawn.DisabledMapIds
#        Description: Disable specific maps for easy respawn system.
#        Values: Map ids separated by commas. Leave empty to not disable anything.
#                Add 631 for example to disable the system in Icecrown Citadel.
#

EasyRespawn.DisabledMapIds =

#
#    EasyRespawn.InstanceRespawnLocation
#        Description: Determines where the player respawns when resurrecting inside an instance.
#        Values: 1 - respawns inside the instance right at the entrance
#                2 - respawns outside the instance right at the entrance
#        Default: 2
#        Note: this is using internal AzerothCore area trigger storage to find the "go back" location for each instance (both for inside and outside). Outside triggers are not found
#              for some instances (for example ICC), so in this case if EasyRespawn.InstanceRespawnLocation is 2, the player will be resurrected inside the instance (acts as if it was set to 1).
#

EasyRespawn.InstanceRespawnLocation = 2

#
#    EasyRespawn.OpenWorldRespawnLocation
#        Description: Determines where the player respawns when resurrecting in open world.
#        Values: 1 - respawns immediately right at the corpse location
#                2 - respawns at the nearest graveyard (recommended)
#        Default: 2
#        Note: If set to 1 the player will immediately respawn (maybe even with full HP if EasyRespawn.ResurrectPct is 1) so this can affect open world PVP experience for example.
#

EasyRespawn.OpenWorldRespawnLocation = 2

#
#    EasyRespawn.OverrideRespawnLocation.[MAP_ID]
#        Description: Be able to override default respawn location for specific maps.
#        Values: EasyRespawn.OverrideRespawnLocation.[MAP_ID] = new_map_id,pos_x,pos_y,pos_z,orientation
#        Example:
#            EasyRespawn.OverrideRespawnLocation.631 = 571,5788.0806,2071.0225,636.0642,3.6041362
#            This will overwrite the respawn location from map 631 (ICC) to the new coordinates: map 571 (Northrend), x = 5788.0806,  y = 2071.0225, z = 636.0642, o = 3.6041362
#

EasyRespawn.OverrideRespawnLocation.631 = 571,5788.0806,2071.0225,636.0642,3.6041362
